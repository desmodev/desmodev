description: Putting your requirements into a brief

Editorial requirements for your research thesis can vary widely and are often determined by your supervisor. 

An important first step in working with an editor is communicating your requirements. 
Think of this as providing a brief. 

An editor will want to know the style you have used throughout your thesis: for example, an author-date style such as APA, or a notes and bibliography (NB) style such as Chicago. 
They may also want to know of any formatting requirements outside of the university or department style guide. 

Your supervisor will most likely have requested that your work conforms to your university’s style guide, although decisions around footnoting and referencing style may have been left to you. Nonetheless, the style must be consistent throughout.

A thesis is substantively the product of original research and as such requires your editor adhere to established guidelines (usually the Australian Standards for Editing Practice) which set out the acceptable level of editorial intervention in the text. 

Ref. I certify that the intellectual content of this thesis is the product of my own work and that all the assistance received in preparing this thesis and sources have been acknowledged.

Therefore, for ethical reasons, your editor will take more of a proofreading approach compared to that of an article or manuscript which may allow for deeper editorial engagement.  

Most institutions now will require that use of an editor be acknowledged in the front matter of the thesis. 

Or, style guide may require … if the editor’s current or former area of academic specialisation is similar to that of the student, this must also be stated.
