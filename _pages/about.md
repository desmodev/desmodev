Welcome! I provide professional proofreading and copy-editing services to HDR students and academics.

I have been involved in many aspects of publishing and media production, including proofreading, copy-editing, news sub-editing, archives development, and photographic and video production. My doctoral study focused on research methods in visual ethnography and post/subcultural theory, and my masters was in the area of ethics and legal studies with a media focus.

Contact me via [email](mailto:des@contentmonkey.com.au) or [phone](tel:+:0421733892) to discuss your requirements. 

For HDR students, the following posts may be helpful in preparing your thesis:

<div class="post">
           <ul>
            {% for post in site.posts %}
              <li>
                <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
              </li>
            {% endfor %}
          </ul>
</div>
