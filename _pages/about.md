Welcome! I provide professional proofreading and copyediting services to HDR students and academics.

I have been involved in many aspects of publishing and media production, including proofreading, copy-editing, newspaper sub-editing, archives development, and photographic and video production. My doctoral study focused on research methods in visual ethnography and post/subcultural theory. I have postgraduate qualifications in ethics and legal studies with a media focus.

Contact me via [email](mailto:des@desdev.au) or [phone](tel:+:0421733892) to discuss your thesis requirements.
