Editorial requirements for your research thesis can vary widely and are often determined by your supervisor. 

An important first step in working with an editor is communicating your requirements. Think of this as providing a brief. 

An editor will want to know the style you have used throughout your thesis; for example, an author-date style such as APA, or a notes and bibliography (NB) style such as Chicago. 

They may also want to know of any formatting requirements outside of the university or department style guide. 

Your supervisor will most likely have requested that your work conform to your university’s style guide.  

In many cases, the choice of footnoting and referencing style are left to the student as long as the style is consistent throughout. 

A thesis is substantively the product of original research and as such requires that your editor follow established guidelines (e.g., the Australian Standards for Editing Practice) which set out the acceptable level of editorial intervention in the text. 

So, for ethical reasons, your editor will be required to carefully moderate their editorial intervention in the text. 

Most institutions now require that the use of an editor be acknowledged in the front matter of the thesis. 

Additionally, further acknowledgement may also be required if the editor’s academic background is similar to the student's area of study.

The University of Sydney (2020) defines the role of copy-editing and proofreading as 'identifying errors in, and correcting, the presentation of the text so as to conform with standard usage and conventions, including:

  - spelling
  - quotations
  - use of italics
  - lists
  - word usage
  - punctuation
  - graphs
  - charts
  - citations
  - references
  - heading hierarchies
  - symbols and equations
  - headers and footers
  - style of numbers'.
